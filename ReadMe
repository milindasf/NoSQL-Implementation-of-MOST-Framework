MOST: NoSQL Solution for Building Data Warehouses

Abstract
==========


In this project we are basically trying to increase the MOST framework performance. MOST is consisted of historical data storage and data
preprocessing functionalities. Currently these data storage and data preprocessing is done using “MySQL” database. Practically BMS (Building
Management Systems) have large amount of data coming from huge number of sensors.  Due to this large chuck of data relational database can't
process these data in a satisfactory level of performance.  So in this project what we will do is move the large data tables (Relations)
from MySQL database to a NoSQL database. Data and Datapoint relations contains lot of data. So our target is to move these two relations to
a NoSQL database. As NoSQL database I have selected Neo4j database. It's a graph database which can handle nearly 34 billion of nodes and 34
billion of relationships between nodes. After we moved some part of the relational schema to a Neo4j we need to have some kind of handler
(translator) which will convert the MySQL queries to graph queries and return the results in a format that the current MOST is compatible. 
By coding this handler we can minimize the changes which we has to do to the current implemented MOST framework. This will save time. Due to
this handler Neo4j database is transparent to the MOST.  The agile software development process is selected to manage this project.
